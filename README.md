## Description
This project started as a fun personal venture with the goal of simplifying my life by eliminating the clutter of remotes in my room. I often found myself annoyed by remotes lying around, and at some point, I thought, "I always have my phone nearbyâ€”wouldn't it be great if I could control my devices with it?" That idea sparked the creation of SAPP.

## Conclusion
Despite the countless hours I spent learning new techniques and experimenting with this project, the outcome was ultimately a bit disappointing. The Raspberry Pi, which served as the core of the system, turned out to be just a little too noisy for me to run it 24/7 in my room. While some of the other challenges I encountered were solvable, they didn't present enough learning opportunities to justify continued development. In the end, these issues led me to the tough decision of no longer using SAPP, despite the potential it had.
